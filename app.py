### ðŸŽ“ Welcome!

This is a prototype learning assistant designed to help you explore careers in instructional design (ID). Whether you're just starting out, switching careers, or already in EdTech, this tool is here to support you with quick and smart answers.

ðŸ’¡ You can ask questions like:
- What skills do I need to become an instructional designer?
- How do I build an ID portfolio?
- What are common tools used in corporate learning?

*This is an early prototypeâ€”expect bugs and surprises!*
